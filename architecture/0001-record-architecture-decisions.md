# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2023-04-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record some lightweight architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

As a mechanism for a more "lightweight" RFC approach for smaller decisions.

Scope could also include larger ones summarised once an RFC/DACI might be accepted.

Some of the dates will be backdated to port/transfer over some of the decisions from our decision log/registry.

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
